# chadCommit

This extension helps you make descriptive commit messages with no hassle. It uses ChatGPT 3.5 turbo (10x cheaper than other models) to suggest you a fitting text based on what changes you've staged. So you can play with it and find perfect commit or edit it.

## Requirements

* You should obtain an OpenAI API key here:
  https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys

* Try to keep your commits small, unstage less important, big, and auto-generated files like package-lock before hitting the suggest button, otherwise you may encounter a token limit error, which is roughly 500 words.
